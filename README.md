# Atmel timer

I had a spare ATMEL-328P lying around and I was beginning ben eaters 6502 project. I didn't buy the timer circuit because I figured I could use my old atmel chips to make it work


Im using the internal clock to power the IC and im using another arduino as isp to program it. I also use minipro with the T48 programmer to program the fuses, though you can do this with avrdude too

## Dependencies

You will need:
- avrdude
- avra (or any avr assembler)
