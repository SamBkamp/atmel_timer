# Atmel timer

I had a spare ATMEL-328P lying around and I was beginning ben eaters 6502 project. I didn't buy the timer circuit because I figured I could use my old atmel chips to make it work


Im using the internal clock to power the IC and im using the XGecu T48 to program it

## Dependancies

You will need:
- gcc-avr
- binutils-avr
- gdb-avr
- avr-libc
- avrdude

apt one-liner for your convenience:
```bash
sudo apt install gcc-avr binutils-avr gdb-avr avr-libc avrdude
```
